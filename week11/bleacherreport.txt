	I chose to review the website Bleacher Report because of the amount of times that I have used their mobile site.  I like their mobile site better than their app because it has a more national focus on sports, than one tailored around me.  Bleacher Report does a good job of dividing all the stories into unique categories and putting a picture up that captures the user by spreading it the full width of the device and only fitting it to a certain horizontal height.  Also each important story has a small picture to go with it so that you know what to expect from each article.
	The reason why Bleacher Report is so great in my opinion, is that they do everything with slideshows.  Its not just a long listed article with just stat lines and words, but pictures and explanations, something that engages a user. Before, Bleacher Report would make users click on a "next" or "previous" buttons to navigate through the slideshow, but now with most smartphones being touchscreen, a simple swipe in the direction you want to proceed is now how you navigate.  Gestures are an important future of web page design, along with immersing users in rich content, which is two things that are unique to Bleacher Report's mobile website.
