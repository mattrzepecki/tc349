				<h4>Essay</h4>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The business website proposal that I have is a housing rental site that will provide the students of East Lansing and Michigan State with a fair opportunity to locate and rent houses within the area. There have been horror stories of how students have been dragged around by housing companies, and the main motivation of this site is to provide a fair housing market for both students and housing companies. So, when it came to sorting cards for the architecture for this website, the categories were chosen to provide students the most relevant categories.  The categories were picked after many open card sorting techniques done by myself. </p>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">I chose to use certain card categories for my participants because of the fear that they would not comprehend the overall goal of making it easiest for students.  I chose two participants for the card sorting and both of them had almost completely had the same sorts that I had.  With differences in housing companies and company (both categories not as important as the other three) I was pleased with the organization that I had created for the site.</p>
