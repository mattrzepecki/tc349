	Chartbeat.com is an intelligent and intuitive user interface that is just plain fun to use.  There are not many websites that really capture a user's attention to detail right away, but with the gorgeous HTML 5 and JavaScript use for the interactive information counters, the website is just fun to scroll through. Along with the scrolling the information that is the purpose behind the site is also displayed in a way that is interactive really makes this website a powerful marketing tool when it is prevalent on how the tools that the site is selling, can work.
	Chartbeat.com also does something that I believe many other websites have been doing, and that is providing all site informaton with full screen content on ONE webpage.  For an information architect who is trying to decide where to put nave bars and menus and search tools, this is a perfect answer to the multiple page problem.  Having all information and a large snippet and interactive tool on each section removes the need for a site to have distracting features like navigation bars, menus, search, advertising, and separate links to different parts of the website.
