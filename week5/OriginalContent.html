				<h4>Essay</h4>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">As I was slowly going through the foldable.me website I noticed right away that the site was laid out to have users get in right away and start creating their foldable person.  There were many different links on seperate parts of the page, and on different pages, that led to the same page of creating the foldable. The website does a great job of giving enough different options to keep someone intrigued with a glance, and someone looking for more information.  What I found to be the problem with the website was the lack of a minimal design via architecture.  What I mean by that is it seems as though whoever designed the website thought, "lets have a page for a, b, b1, c1, ca1 and actually c too, while all pages come back to page a." where there needs to be only 3 pages to support all the website's and user's needs. </p>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">As displayed in my version of the website architecture, only three separate branches (with the social branch being just a logo link on each page) are needed to organize the site efficiently.  I separated the design process, the user information needed for the site, and the site info into these separate branches because of what they had in common with each other.  The website info branch is self explanatory, but during the card sorting process, separating the creation branch and personal branch was difficult because the creations are personal! What it came down to was the separation of the general process of creating the foldable person from everything else.  The entry video serves as the on site advertisement, the creation page where the user spends the most time and creates the foldable, and the personalization of the person after.  The Personal branch wasn't a garbage bin of all other pages that were left over, but it was the thought that each page would mean that the user has garnered enough interest into the website that they will committ their "personal" time (blog), information (login), and money (basket and gift certificates).</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The design process that I chose to use for my participants was closed card sorting over open card sorting because of the interesting obstacles I had run into that I described before.  I wanted to see how other users would handle some of the similar situations I ran into.  My two participants are a finance major and a criminal justice major, and pay no attention to web design or the IT field whatsoever.  Surprisingly, the finance major separated the cards almost exactly the same way that I had, but chose to have the blogs in the "social" branches.  The criminal justice major depicted all of the branches as a "process" where most of the Login, Creation Page, Final Person, Basket, and Gift Certificate were depicted under the creation branch.</p>
