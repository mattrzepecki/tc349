	United Pixelworkers is a website that uses flat design.  Flat design doesn't use any 3D shaping or shadowing to make the items on the page look like they are actually popping out.  With the flat design United Pixelworkers has a "cool" feel to it that uses many hipster styling that will always catch the eye of younger users, who seem to be the targeted market. 
	The grid layout of the entire website shows that it is designed for the user to just stay on the homepage.  The user can just stay on the homepage and not have to leave the homepage to get a good feel of what the entire site has to offer.  Now there are more options sat the navigation bar at the top that is also done with a flat design and there are options in the grid to do many different things including some social media inserts.
