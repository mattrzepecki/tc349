	The MSU mobile site is designed very well with icon based navigation and scrolling horizontal menus that make it easy for a person on a mobile device to navigate easily and to know exactly where they are.  The file path animation at the top of the site is a very cool tool that I found myself looking for quite a bit, and then on other sites it was something that I noticed was missing.  The slick look of each navigable page, by giving all the information that one would want on a mobile site, means that this site was well thought out and very well organized.  
	MSU mobile also uses all of the same themes on each of the page so that no matter what you know that you are on an MSU page.  That is something that I believe to be an advantage for MSU as people will become more engaged in something that they are familiar with, like the University.  There is also alway a search bar on each and every page. I believe this is a nice touch because sometimes navigating on a mobile device can be very frustrating.  With the search bar added to each page, a user does not have to give up and go away from the mobile site, all they have to do is search in that search bar.
