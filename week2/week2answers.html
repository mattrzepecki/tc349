	<h3>My name is Matt Rzepecki and my main area of study is Telecommunications. I was drawn into this because of my love of tech products that I have procured over the years, and mainly because I am an Apple fanboy. I am mainly interested in project management and product development.  Be it from IT infrastructure of a business to a graphical UI of a website, I am interested in mainly the human interactions of technology and how users can take full advantage of it.  I have interned the past two summers with a Managed Security Service provider called Nuspire Networks and will probably start my career there within the calendar year.  The skills I have are creativity, which is surprisingly something that you need within the IT world.  Thinking outside the box requires creativity and I believe that is what my true skill is. In my personal life I have a girlfriend, love hanging with my friends, and have a passion for all sports.  My motto that I live by is "Don't just exist, live."</h3>

	<h3>panic.com is a great website, especially whom it is designed for.  Being a user of some panic products I have seen the elegance that they use and how easy they make it for novices.  The tools that they use in Coda are also magnificent and they have definitely put them to use with their website.
		Any person that is coming to their website will instantly get excited about their products.  With the ability to actually see on a small scale of what they can do there is no way that a person wouldn't be intrigued to check out what all of their products have to offer.</h3>
