	The Michigan State University, or msu.edu, homepage is one of the better home pages compared to that of many other B1G universities.  With the use of flash showing promoted stories and articles that lead to different parts of the website as the main attraction, this part of the page instantly captures a visitor's attention with different animations and great pictures.  When it comes to the structure of the website, the page is navigable and easy for any users.  With a search bar, directory bar that shows Flash animated menus when scrolling, and more links that direct different types of users, the page's overall structure is easy to use.
	As you scroll down there are other interactive windows that show integration with the school events, social media regarding the university, school news, and student features that pertain to all audiences that are usually attending the site (prospective, current, and former students). All windows are done very subtly and organized.  The overall feel for the homepage is very contemporary, and to a user seems well updated and maintained, which is a big key for making first time visitors returning visitors.
