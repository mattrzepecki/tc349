	Etsy.com is not a very flashy website, but it does get the desired job done.  The site's purpose seems to be to sell the products on the site, and with the clean and finished structure of the site, it does that very well.  As a user chooses a certain object to which product they would like to see, the webpage then brings up a larger image and more images that could allow a user more views of the product.  With a brief description of the product and usually some measurements, a user feels satisfied enough to purchase a product just off of the page they are currently on.  As a web designer that has to a top accomplishments. 
	The homepage of etsy.com is organized and structured perfectly as well. Although there is not a lot of flashy items and gadgetries that usually comes with some sites, etsy.com is clean and most of all, useful.   With a search bar, cart option, and membership info displayed across the top, along with an organized and easy to use browse section stacked vertically on the left hand side of the page, a user (in this case a shopper) can easily find all the possible options that they are trying to use.
