The website Heroku.com is another easy to use and navigable page with a tiered look at navigation. At the top of the website is quick access links that lead to other important parts of the webpage, along with a  title bar that shows some upcoming events. The next tier of navigation seems to use flash and shows the variability of the product that Heroku.com is trying to sell.  With interactive statistics and a sign up link right below, a new user to the site will be able to see all the important information about Heroku.com by just looking at their browser and without the need to navigate away from the homepage.
As you scroll down there are more navigation types to features that Heroku.com would like for what seems to be returning users to the site. Even below that there are more quick and easy link setups that are shown, along with a  site tree that someone must have established through some sort of card sorting. Overall the website looks amazing with the single color scheme used through out and the navigable home page which allows a new user, recurrent user, or Heroku themselves to navigate to any part of their product line and website.
