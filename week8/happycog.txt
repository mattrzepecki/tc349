	Happy Cog design layout is one of the best that I have seen when it comes to providing all information in a certain manner.  Happy Cog is a business that starts off with a link for a potential client, because that is what they are, a business trying to sign new clients.  With the business aspect of it starting at the header of the page, the body has a very familiar logo just in case you were not familiar with Happy Cog. By providing MTV as the second image you see on the website, you instantly give Happy Cog more respect within the design community.  There is even a link to help prove that the collaboration between Happy Cog and MTV was a very successful one.  There are also many other client profiles right under to continue the legitimacy of the site.  After this the layout of the site is like a good essay, one part leads into another because it keeps you asking for the next logical step.  
	The actual fluidity of the layout is also so easy to use because you just have to scroll.  The links are minimal but inviting and the links provide a clear and concise, and striking curiosity, effect that makes you want to click it.  The different background colors also tells you that you are in a section and that you can look forward to new and important information in that section.
