				<h2>Real Reviews</h2>
					<p>"The house that we lived in was amazing, but out land lord was a jerk and charged us for some ridiculous things. The location is amazing though, close to campus and right by downtown. Most of my friends live in the area but we all had to deal with the same land lord. As long as you have your friends close by, it will make up for it."- Kevin, Junior</p>
