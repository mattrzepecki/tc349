	I chose this setup because of the ability of my Mac to switch screens in full screen mode between Google Chrome and these two developer programs.  I like the ability to switch back and forth very quickly with just a flick of the fingers because it makes it easier for me to go from viewing a YouTube lesson, to typing the code I have just seen.  I chose to use the default Terminal app that Apple supplies because of past experiences.  I have used HomeBrew before for my Python class that needed an upgrade of the default shell.  I also chose TextMate because it was the easiest one to install, find, and use because of my already used free trial of Dreamweaver.  Moving around with the full screen mode can be tricky at times, so I also use my television as a second screen via AirPlay and Apple TV that allows me to watch the class videos online.
