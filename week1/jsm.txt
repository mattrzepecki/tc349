	The Jason Santa Maria website is a website that is designed well by capturing the visitor's eye and showing some simple ways of organization that are always welcome, there are some missing elements that make it architecturally not as easy to navigate. As a first time visitor to the site, the page seemed clean and anyone could instantly get the notion that this web designer had some experience.  
	With the chronological posts that all capture the eye, a person who visits this site will recognize right away that this is a personal site with Jason's (or whatever the person's actual name is) opinions and informational blog posts.  By having this layout on most of the pages there is nothing wrong with appealing to the first time visitor and visitors that come back.  For a lot of users this might be one of the key points of their return where they could come back due to the fact they know exactly the content is on the page that they want.  
	The architectural layout of the page is what bothers me.  With the search bar at the bottom of the page, and the top bar not displaying any information or distinguishing itself from the rest of the page, it draws the user to believe that only the front page is what is important.  Really, there are many pages here that have valuable information and the site does not bring the user to believe so.
